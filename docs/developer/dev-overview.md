# Overview

NEAR Protocol offers development paths for WEB2/WEB3 devs to get started with the ecosystem. If you're joining from web2 then Assemblyscript may be a great place to start. Existing web3 devs may find RUST a more natural fit. Whichever path you choose you can find the tools, resources, and support to help you journey through the NEARVerse.
