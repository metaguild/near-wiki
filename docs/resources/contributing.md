# Contributing

This Wiki is Community driven and all contributions about NEAR and it's ecosystem are welcomed.

## How to Contribute

To contribute, you can use Github repository: https://github.com/near/wiki. You can edit any file there by clicking "Edit this page" \(you will need to sign up for Github\).

Once logged in, you will be in the editor. The editor allows to edit "Markdown" files - a special formatting used for this Wiki. When you are done with changes, you can describe what have you done in the text field at the bottom.

Next step will be to create a Pull Request that will inform the editors of Wiki to review your changes and accept them.

Remember that after you click "Propose Changes", you must also click on "Create Pull Request" on the next page.

_If you become a frequent contributor, you will be granted a "Writer" access to the Wiki in Gitbook._
